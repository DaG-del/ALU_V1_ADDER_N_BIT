Verilog.xlsx is a file to store work-division among everyone.

full_adder_1_bit is the submodule with a 1 bit adder with carry in and out

incrementer is the code that will update the counter till N to select the input/output bit to work with

the multiplexer module will take the incrementer output and select the corresponding bits for addition in that iteration

n_bit_adder.v will bring all these together

test_bench will be used to test the code with a clock pulse and many N-bit inputs
